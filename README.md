# App Switcher ++ (in Alpha)

App Switcher ++ is a tool for super users that use many applications and windows, and need to work fast.

App Switcher is something similar like alt + tab in Windows and look much like alt + tab in Windows 10. 

But it gives you the opportunity to set up your hotkeys at dwelling to group windows and switch between windows. 

If you, for instance want hotkey (Alt + C) to  switch between Chrome windows, the window does make easy.

The program was originally intended to use the same X-Keys keyboard. But at the request of several I have made support to set up hotkeys without having an X-Keys Keyboard.
