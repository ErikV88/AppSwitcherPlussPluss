# App Switcher ++ (in Alpha)

App Switcher ++ is a tool for super users that use many applications and windows, and need to work fast.

App Switcher++ is something similar like alt + tab in Windows and look much like alt + tab in Windows 10. 
But it gives you the opportunity to add hotkeys to group windows and switch between them. 

If you, for instance want hotkey (Alt + C) to  switch between Chrome windows, in AppSwitcher++ meke that easy.

The program was originally intended to use the same X-Keys keyboard. But at the request of several I have made support to set up hotkeys without having an X-Keys Keyboard.
